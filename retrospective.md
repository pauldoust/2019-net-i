# 2019-03-07 Retrospective

## Difficulties faced

* Troubleshooting on threading was tedious with more than one machine and logs increasing exponentially 
* Simulating case scenario during integration testing while interface was not built 
* We did not make good use of Trello as a project management Tool ( lack of consistency )
* Handling bytes in String was a bit challenging
* Architecture and design are hard and they took a lot of time
* Managing complexity got more and more difficult as project grew
* Once tired, was hard to resist hacking away at the problem instead of thinking it through
* Version control difficulties

## Lessons learned

* Give more time to requirements, architecture and design. Try different approaches
* Make good commit comments and keep the work process clean
* Read good code and bad code (to know what they both are)
* Working with external Team is challenging 
* Keeping track of the project progress is difficult without a project management tool  
* Implement Service Managers for Jobs helps in decreasing the overhead in troubleshooting on serveral tread
* We learn treading, Queue management, Socket Programming, P2P architecture and GIT

## What we would keep next time

* We would keep the same/similar Project Roadmap and planning. 
* Implement simple architecture and complexify  it over time  during the  implementation phase the product is completed  
* Modulirised architectures
* Constant meeting (online and offline) to align on the progress made by each member 
* Use of Githup for project collaboration 
* Working in pairs (one implementing  and another member validating)
* Keeping Trello for project management 
* Good Programming practises, like indentation, commenting modules and each functions and performing unit testing and integration testing

## What we would do differently

* Better planning and management. More time for architecture and design
* Check out good existing solutions for ideas, talk to someone experienced
* Documentation Draft could have been done along side with coding 
* Establish  "requirement change procedure"  from the initial meeting 
* Make extensive use of Trello to track progress on Project
