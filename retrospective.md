## Difficulties faced
* architecture and design are hard and they took a lot of time
* managing complexity got more and more difficult as project grew
* once tired, was hard to resist hacking away at the problem instead of thinking it through
* version control madness

## Lessons learned

Give more time to requirements, architecture and design. Try different approaches. 
Make good commit comments and keep the work process clean. Read good code
and bad code (to know what they both are).

## What I would keep next time

Same work process.

## What I would do differently

Better planning and management. More time for architecture and design. Check out good existing
solutions for ideas. Talk to someone experienced. Take deep breaths, go outside more often.
